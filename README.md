# Project Overview


🔹 What This System Will Do?

This Blockchain Voting System will:
✅ Verify voter identity using Election Community digital credentials.
✅ Allow secure voting through blockchain smart contracts.
✅ Ensure transparent election results that cannot be altered.
✅ Follow Election Community regulations to make blockchain voting legally acceptable.

🛠 Workflow of the System

1️⃣ Voter Registration:

    Government issues Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to eligible voters.
    Voter creates a Decentralized Identifier (DID) using Hyperledger Indy.

2️⃣ Voter Authentication:

    When a voter logs in, their identity is verified using Hyperledger Aries.
    If valid, they proceed to vote; otherwise, they cannot access the voting system.

3️⃣ Casting the Vote:

    Voter selects a candidate and submits their vote.
    Smart contracts (Chaincode) store the vote on Hyperledger Fabric.

4️⃣ Vote Counting & Transparency:

    The system automatically counts votes in real-time.
    No tampering is possible since votes are stored securely on blockchain.

5️⃣ Results Announcement:

    Election results are publicly available for verification.
    Any person can audit the blockchain to check election integrity.

📌 This process ensures a secure, fair, and government-compliant election.




# eVoting System using Hyperledger Fabric

A secure, transparent, and decentralized electronic voting platform built with **Hyperledger Fabric**, **React.js**, **Node.js**, and **MongoDB**. The system supports multiple user roles—**Admin**, **Election Commission**, **Voter**, and **Candidate**—with features including vote casting, candidacy application, complaint handling, result declaration, and role-based dashboards.
